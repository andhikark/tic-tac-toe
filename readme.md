A multi-player Tic Tac Toe game you can play online in your browser. Consists of three game modes: 3 x 3, 5 x 5, 7 x 7. In addition, I added some features such as resetting the game and returning to the home page.

## Technologies I Used
* OS: Linux Ubuntu
* Editor: VS Code
* Source control provider: GitHub
* Tech stack:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript

## Outcomes
By working on this project, I've learned a lot of things along the way, such as:
* Using module patterns to wrap some particular variables and functions and invoke them immediately by using IIFE.
* Using factory functions to set up, return, and duplicate objects, without using `new`.
* How to add video and audio in the background of the page.
